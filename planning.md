## TODO's Version 1
- feature: highlight all search hits on all screens with a style (e.g. underline or background color)
  - main screen: mark line
  - object screen: mark line
  - value details screen: mark text section

## (Version 2): Should be a fork with a different name - e.g. json-viewer
- rewrite: generalize viewer to any kind of json and any object depth

## Maybe's
- maybe feature: implement search functionality also in value detail screen
- maybe feature: settings screen
- maybe feature: customize all colors
- maybe feature: Use Memory Mapped Files for RawJsonLines
